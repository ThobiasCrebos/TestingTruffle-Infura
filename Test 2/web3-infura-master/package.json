  "description": "`Web3.js` is a collection of libraries which allow you to interact with a local or remote Ethereum node using an HTTP or IPC connection. In this exercise, we will use `web3.js` to deploy a contract on the Ethereum Ropsten testnet and play with it. We will first compile a contract, deploy it and finally call some of the contractâ€™s functions. In order for web3 to connect to the Ropsten testnet, we will use `Infura.io` API as our provider.",
